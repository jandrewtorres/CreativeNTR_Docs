# How to Use

Once the CreativeNTR annotator is turned on for a desired page, the toolbar should be seen on the right side of the screen. Opening this toolbar allows for all the comments made on that page to be seen \(if you have logged in\). 

After selecting a text, the highlight or comment options pop up. Selecting one of those will anchor that type of annotation to that selection. The comment text will appear on the right after it is saved. 

Clicking on the "eye" button will hide or show all annotations on that page.

Clicking on the "post-it" button will create a page comment - where a comment is made but is anchored to the whole page instead of a text selection.

Clicking on the "doodle" button will allow a drawing to be made anywhere on the screen. This drawing will be anchored to the place you draw it.

Clicking on the "magic eraser" button will allow part of an existing drawing to be erased selecting with your mouse.
